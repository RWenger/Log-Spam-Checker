3. Use

----------------------

Find the log file you wish to analyze.  Your website's log file may be in a separate 
 folder of your host called "logs" or something similar. Then, copy the log (the log
 may be named "yourDomain.com") to the same directory you installed to in step 2. The
 log file should be in the same folder as index.php.
 
 Once your log file is in the same folder as index.php, rename it to log.txt. Then 
load index.php in your web browser.  After the log file has been analyzed, you can 
use sort the tables by  clicking on entries in the top row.
